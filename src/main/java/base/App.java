Exercise 3 - Printing Quotes:

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print
out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in
the example output.

Example Output:
What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

Constraints:
-Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques
 for quotes.
-If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, don’t use it for this exercise.
 Use string concatenation instead.

Challenge:
Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that
holds quotes and their associated attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in
the example. An array of maps would be a good choice.
